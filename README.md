# Cta_Prediction

## Description
The Cta_Prediction repository summarizes my work on the topic of CTA prediction for statistical research conducted at the University of Michigan. This README file serves as a guide on using the repository. All code and results mentioned in the report can be found here.

For example, if you want to find the code for the Missing Value Treatment section in the report, navigate to the code/Missing Value Treatment folder.

All figures in the report can be found in the report figures folder.

If you need instructions for using Great Lakes (the cloud computing service used for this project), check out the slurm great lakes instruction.pdf file.

The three Excel files in the repository correspond to the sections with the same name in the report. Note that the Case1A and Random Forest Tuning results are combined into one Excel file.
