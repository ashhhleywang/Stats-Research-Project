# Cta_Prediction

## Description
The Cta_Prediction repository summarizes my work on the topic of CTA prediction for statistical research conducted at the University of Michigan. This README file serves as a guide on using the repository. All code and results mentioned in the report can be found here.

Every .R file* can be run independently without running another .R file beforehand. Folders have identical names with their corresponding sections in the report. For example, the folder "Missing Value Treatment" contains codes used in section 3 "Missing Value Treatment" in the report.

All figures in the report can be found in the report figures folder.

If you need instructions for using Great Lakes (the cloud computing service used for this project), check out "slurm great lakes instruction.pdf".

The three Excel files in "Report Tables" Folder correspond to the sections with the same name in the report. Note that the Variable Impact Exploration in Case1A and Random Forest Tuning results are combined into one Excel file.

*Except mF_result.R in folder Missing Value Treatment, you need to run missforest_generate_fulldata.R first to obtain a no-NA dataset
